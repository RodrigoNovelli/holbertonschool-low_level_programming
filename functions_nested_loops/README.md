In this directory we will use c functions and nested loops.

A function in C it's like of block of reusable code, a specific task that its part of the entire procces. 
Using functions makes our code easy to write, but it also make it easier to read it when we need to change something or when we need to someone else to understand the code. 

You always need to declare a function before it is referenced, for this can use a FUNCTION PROTOTYPE:
its only the declaration of the function where you give the type of return, the function name and the arguments, but you can give the definition later. This is essencial for the compiler as it knows what to especut.

A nested loop is a loop inside a loop:
while (condition)
{
   while (condition of nested)
   {
   }
}
The program will perform the nested loop until the main loop is complete.
